# ðŸ”® miniRT - Our First Ray Tracer ðŸ”®

## Introduction

Weâ€™re two passionate coders with a shared curiosity about how 3D graphics and visual effects work. Having explored various programming challenges, we wanted to tackle something truly ambitious â€“ something that bridges our love for mathematics, problem-solving, and visual creativity. Enter miniRT.

### Why miniRT? 

- **Hands-on Learning**: It allows us to dive into 3D rendering basics.
- **Applying Math in Code**: See complex formulas in action.
- **C Programming**: An exciting challenge using our favorite language.
